                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm an aspiring software developer. I've completed a year in industry with Oxford Economics and I'm
                    now returning to the University of Surrey for my final year of study, aiming to achieve a 1st.
                    I'm looking ahead for 2025
                    graduate roles in the fields of software development and data analytics.
                    <br><br>
                    I have experience working with various programming languages and technologies including C#, Python,
                    Java and SQL. My placement year has given me experience working in a professional environment,
                    where I gained familiarity with agile software development, Azure DevOps, Git version control
                    and code reviews.
                    <br><br>
                    My placement year and other previous work experience has helped me to develop my communication
                    and teamwork skills for collaborative and professional software development.

        <h3>University projects</h3>
        <p>
            At university I have taken a wide variety of modules covering programming, web development,
            mathematics, operating systems, computer networking, data structures and algorithms, artifical
            intelligence and many more.

            I completed a wide range of coursework projects, below are some examples and details of projects I
            have worked on.
        </p>

        <h4>University Accommodation Website</h4>
        For the module 'Web and Database Systems' in my 1st year I had to develop a font-end website that interacts with a back-end
        database. We were given various options and I chose to create a university accommodation website.
        <br><br>
        For the task I had to create an EER model and database schema for the report. Then I had to write MySQL queries,
        PHP code to bridge between the MySQL and the front-end website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
        <br><br>
        <h4>Database analytics program</h4>
        <p>
            For the module 'software engineering' also in my 1st year I had to build a database analytics program in Java. The lecturers
            provided us with code to set up the system and connect to the database. We worked with the sample MySQL
            Sakila database, which contains data and tables for a video rental store.

            The coursework involved translating informal requirements into semi-formal use case diagrams and UML
            sequence diagrams. I then wrote MySQL queries and then wrote the Java code for the database analytics program.

            I also wrote Java test cases using consisting of SQL queries executed in Java. These test cases were unit
            tests with the library JUnit. I used the Eclipse IDE for this project.
        </p>
        <h4>School club management system</h4>
        <p>
            I completed this coursework in my 2nd year for the module "web applications development". In this module we
            learnt Python and Django to build web applications. For the coursework we were given free choice to develop
            a web application to meet certain criteria.

            I built a school club management system. I used the model-view-controller (MVC) system that allows students
            student, staff and club details to be entered into the system. I was able to create a CRUD application that
            can create, read, update and delete data from the database.

            For this project I used Python and Django, HTML, CSS including SASS and the Pycharm IDE.
        </p>
        <h4>Food diary web application</h4>
        <p>
            I completed this project for the module 'Software engineering project' in my 2nd year. For this module I
            worked in a group of 6 students to create a web application of our choice. We also had to include at least
            2 APIs in this project and the web application had to align with the UN Sustainable development goals.
            <br><br>
            Our group chose to create a food diary web application to encourage users to eat more healthily. We used the
            Spoonacular API to allow the user to search for recipes. The user can add recipes to their food diary to help
            users keep track of their meals. Other features include a filter to filter recipes to exclude allergens or
            to cater for different diets (e.g. vegetarian) and the ability to search for meals by a certain ingredient.
            We also used the YouTube iFrame API to play a wide variety of videos to teach key cooking skills to encourage users to cook healthy meals instead of ordering takeaways.
            <br><br>
            I made lots of contributions to this project. I implemented many features to the web application including
            setting up the recipe searching with the Spoonacular API, the recipe filtering feature and the search by
            ingredients feature. I also contributed to the various report sections such as legal, feasibility and coding
            practices. We also rotated the project manager role during the project and I took on the project
            management role for 3 weeks over the Easter break. I ran the meetings, planned and allocated the work. This
            experience helped me to develop my teamwork and communication skills.
            <br><br>
            For this project we used Python and the Django framework, HTML, CSS (including SASS) and JavaScript
            including (JQuery) and the PyCharm IDE.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h4>AI models</h4>
        <p>
            For the artificial intelligence coursework in my 2nd year I completed a coursework where I created AI models
            to classify blood cell image data. I used many models including k Nearest Neighbours (KNN), logistic regression
            and deep learning models including Multi Layer Perception (MLP) and Convolution Neural Network (CNN).
            <br><br>
            I then tuned each hyperparameters to increase accuracy whilst avoiding overfitting the data. Then I compared
            metrics for these models including training accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score. I then presented my work
            as a poster.
            <br><br>
            For this project I used Python with the package Tensorflow.

        <h3>Side Projects</h3>
        <h4>Portfolio Website</h4>
        <p>
            This website is a side project aiming to showcase my skills and experience to employers.
            This website was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and the IDE Webstorm.

        <h4>Java FX True False Game</h4>
        <p>
            I created a True/False game in Java. I learnt how to use the library Java FX to create a graphical user
            interface. I used the IDE Eclipse for this project.
        </p>

        <h4>Raspberry Pi Thermometer and data analytics program</h4>
        <p>
            Another side project I completed was a thermometer program. I used various electrical components and a
            Raspberry Pi to create the program. I then wrote Python code to create a graphical user interface to
            display the temperature readings.
            <br><br>
            I also used Python packages to calculate analytics on the data.
        </p>

        <h4>Android app development with Kotlin </h4>
        <p>
            I'm currently learning Android app development with Kotlin. I am learning the basics of Kotlin and Android
            development using JetPack compose. I'm hoping to develop this into a final year project at university.
            I'm getting to know the IDE Android Studio for this project.

        <h3>EPQ Calculator Project</h3>
        <p>
            I created a calculator project in Java for my Extended Project Qualification (EPQ) whilst completing my
            A-levels. I learnt how to create graphical user interfaces and managed to create a functioning scientific
            calculator program.
            I used the IDE eclipse for this project.
